    <br/>

    <p class="para1"><b style="color: red;">Ques 10:</b> <b style="color: red;">How does Internet works?</b></p>
    <p class="para2"><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> The Internet connects millions of computers to each other so that they can interact with each other and also transmit data to each other:</p>
    <ul type="square">
        <li class="list">Internet uses a packet switching technique to transmit the data. Thus, the data to be sent is divided into packets and the data is sent in the form of packets only. Each packet of data contains various information like the address of the destination, error control information, etc.</li>
        <li class="list">Internet majorly uses protocols called Internet Protocol (IP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to transmit data from one computer to another.</li>
        <li class="list">Internet Protocol (IP) The internet protocol is a network layer protocol that is responsible for defining the rules that define how the information is sent over an internet connection from one computer to another.</li>
        <li class="list">Internet Protocol is responsible for gathering the addresses to which the data is to be transmitted.</li>
        <li class="list">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) The transmission control protocol (TCP) is a transport layer protocol that works along with the internet protocol to transmit data over the internet. It is a connection-oriented and reliable protocol i.e. it establishes the connection first and then only, sends data over the established connection hence, there is no packet loss in the transmission control protocol.</li>
        <li class="list">Transmission Control Protocol is responsible for the delivery of data once the Internet protocol gets the IP address of the destination.</li>
        <li class="list">Also, there are several other protocols that are used by the internet for different purposes. For example, it uses Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send mail from one client to another, it uses File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to transfer files over the internet, it uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) through which a browser (client) can interact with the internet server.</li>

    <p class="para2"><b>Step 3: Learn Frameworks and library:</b> Frameworks are a template where the developer can add, edit and alter the coding according to their needs. Although learning a programming language helps the developer to write any code, learning and using a framework is a time-saving way where you can use the same framework for multiple purposes. It cuts off rewriting the code every time.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>Step 4: Learn the Database Concept:</b> A database is a kind of storage zone and a structured data storage that can be accessed electronically. Learning about the database is vital for back-end developers because it is the vault where they store the data through their programming language.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>Step 5: Hands-on Training:</b> Theoretical knowledge will never suffice in any field. The developer can not understand the techniques and formats behind any programming language until they practice it. Write your code and run it in the coder. Analyze the errors. Following its start developing small apps like notes app, Weather app, Amazon clone, Zomato clone, etc.,</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>Step 6: Idea and Develop:</b> With enough practice, create unique ideas and develop them into any software. It is always better to start by modifying the existing software's algorithm and understanding the modifications' output. Once done, start developing your idea and add it to your portfolio.</p>
    <p class="para2"><b>Step 7: Launch Your Idea:</b> Now it is time for the developer to make their product available online like any cloud service that provides www. access. Pitch your product to multiple companies and bag your back-end developer job.</p>
