    <br/>

    <p><b style="color: red;">Ques 7:</b> <b style="color: red;">How does Internet works?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> The Internet connects millions of computers to each other so that they can interact with each other and also transmit data to each other:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Internet uses a packet switching technique to transmit the data. Thus, the data to be sent is divided into packets and the data is sent in the form of packets only. Each packet of data contains various information like the address of the destination, error control information, etc.</li>
        <li>Internet majorly uses protocols called Internet Protocol (IP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to transmit data from one computer to another.</li>
        <li>Internet Protocol (IP) The internet protocol is a network layer protocol that is responsible for defining the rules that define how the information is sent over an internet connection from one computer to another.</li>
        <li>Internet Protocol is responsible for gathering the addresses to which the data is to be transmitted.</li>
        <li>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) The transmission control protocol (TCP) is a transport layer protocol that works along with the internet protocol to transmit data over the internet. It is a connection-oriented and reliable protocol i.e. it establishes the connection first and then only, sends data over the established connection hence, there is no packet loss in the transmission control protocol.</li>
        <li>Transmission Control Protocol is responsible for the delivery of data once the Internet protocol gets the IP address of the destination.</li>
        <li>Also, there are several other protocols that are used by the internet for different purposes. For example, it uses Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send mail from one client to another, it uses File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to transfer files over the internet, it uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) through which a browser (client) can interact with the internet server.</li>

    <p><b style="color: red;">Ques 17:</b> <b style="color: red;">What is Layout and Rendering engine?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> The layout and Rendering Engine of a web page is typically specified by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Each style sheet is a series of rules which the browser engine interprets. For example, some rules specify typography details, such as font, color, and text size. The engine combines all relevant CSS rules to calculate precise graphical coordinates for the visual representation it will paint on the screen.</p>
    <p><b>*</b> Some engines may begin layout and rendering before a page's resources are downloaded. This can result in visual changes as more data is received, such as gradually filling in images or a flash of unstyled content.</p>
    <br/>

    <p><b style="color: red;">Ques 18:</b> <b style="color: red;">What is JavaScript engine?</b></p>
    <p><b style="color: green;">Ans:</b> A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code. The first JavaScript engines were merge interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance.</p>
    <p><b>*</b> JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one. In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concern with the rendering engine via the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
    <br/>

    <p><b style="color: red;">Ques 19:</b> <b style="color: red;">How does it know about the part to use for layout and process in Web Development?</b></p>
